# RAG without KGE models

In this notebook we implement a RAG pipeline that consists of the following three modules:

+ Knowledge base, where the triples are extracted

+ Vector database, where the triples are stored in the vector database (Weaviate)

+ RAG, where the Retrieval and the Generation is performed
