I have detected a high volume of SYN packets to one of my Servers, what could this be due to?

I detected many incoming UDP packets to my network that have “ANY” as an argument. What might this be due to?
MATCH (dc:ns2__DataComponent)
RETURN DISTINCT dc.uri AS uri
UNION
MATCH (ap:ns2__AttackPattern)
RETURN DISTINCT ap.uri AS uri

Are there DNS, NTP, or other UDP-based services in my network?
MATCH (s:ns0__Network)-[p:ns1__contains]->(o)
WHERE tolower(o.rdfs__label) CONTAINS "dns" OR tolower(o.rdfs__label) CONTAINS "ntp"
RETURN o.uri AS uri

Can you explain how a DNS amplification attack works?
MATCH (n)
WHERE tolower(n.rdfs__label) CONTAINS "amplification" 
RETURN n.uri AS subject, "description" AS predicate, n.ns2__description AS object


Can you explain how a Reflection Amplification attack works?

MATCH (ap:ns2__AttackPattern)
WHERE ap.rdfs__label = "Reflection Amplification"
RETURN ap.ns2__description

MATCH (ap:A)
WHERE tolower(n.rdfs__label) CONTAINS "amplification" 
RETURN n.uri AS subject, "description" AS predicate, n.ns2__description AS object

What services use DNSServer for domain name resolution in my network?
MATCH (s:ns0__Network)-[p:ns1__contains]->(o)
WHERE tolower(o.rdfs__label) CONTAINS "dns" 
RETURN o.uri

How can I mitigate a DNS amplification attack?
MATCH (s)-[p:`ns2__mitigates`]->(o)
WHERE tolower(o.rdfs__label) CONTAINS "amplification"
RETURN s.uri AS subject, type(p) AS predicate, o.uri AS object
UNION
MATCH (s)-[p:`ns2__mitigates`]->(o)
WHERE tolower(o.rdfs__label) CONTAINS "amplification"
RETURN s.uri AS subject, "description" AS predicate, s.ns2__description AS object
